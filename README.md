## About voicetransmission.sh

I have a project called LinuxRealTimeVoipProgram in my repository. It sends udp packets carrying alsa's output across the network to the target machine where packets get rebuilt.

I tried doing the same thing using command line utilites.

Although this setup works to a some extent, there is some lag in sound that I don't know why it happens. However, it is still possible to get meaningful output.

I don't know if it is possible to fix the issue. I think a decent bash script is possible for a real P2P communication for voice chat.

The benefit of being truly P2P is that it is a lot harder to trace the communication for a 3rd party.

I would like to hear your opinions about how communication could be accomplished that does not lag by means of command line utilities.
